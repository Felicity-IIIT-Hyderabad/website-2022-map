jagruti	Jagruti	The symbol of IIITH. No, I mean literally. This is THE LOGO of IIITH. A big hairy old banyan tree, probably older than a lot of us. 
forest	Forest	You’ll find a lot of snakes here. But don’t worry, you already live among snakes all the time. Nothing to worry about here. *coughs in KASSI*
bakul	Bakul	The boys hostel, one of the few, houses almost 500 boys. Famous for its long corridor. A walk around the corridor is good enough exercise.
bakul_warehouse	Bakul Warehouse	Home to a few indoor game tables and where I’m currently being held captive, forced to write these descriptions.
amphi	Amphi	The colosseum of IIITH. No word of a lie, this is a very wonderful place to take your load off after exams. Maggi+Frooti+Amphi = Turu Lob
nilgiri	Nilgiri	Is one of the oldest buildings on campus. This was a government office back when IIIT wasn’t there. Well, this cozy ex-government building has labs and storage rooms.
bbc	BBC	Bhaiyya Cheese Maggi!!!. Bhaiyya Paneer Dosa!!!. One of the 3 canteens, hands down the best coffee, and the only place where you can get a dosa whenever you want to.
football_ground	Football Ground	On an average IIITH evening, you would see people painfully trying to do exercise here. Other times, you may see flags around here for intra-college competition.
parijat	Parijat	The only girls hostel in IIITH. (Don’t know what’s inside)
kadamb	NBH/Kadamb	Kadamb mess, which supposedly stays empty for almost all of the week. Except when there’s chicken biryani. You are going to have to wait in a circular-queue™ ®   (trust me, I’m serious).
felicity_ground	FG	This is the ground that has been the venue of the college’s annual fest, FELICITY, since the beginning. Also has volleyball, tennis courts.
obh	OBH	*cue swag entry* Old. Boys. Hostel. Has 2 messes, North and South. You are gonna have to wait in the dosa-queue™ to get it. Has a badminton court. Don’t be scared if you see girls here and there. (they are just here for the mess. I think…)
jc	JC	The little things that matter. Wanna take a small break from your routine? Refresh your mind? JC is here for you. Birthday nearing? You’re gonna have your birthday beating here. *slapping chappal noises*
guesthouse	Guest House	Wait, let me get my marker. *strikes guest*. Perfect. Call it g̵u̵e̵s̵t̵ house. I never see any guests in there anyway. But, one thing’s for sure. The lawn is very pleasant. Don’t worry if you see people meditating and getting enlightened in this lawn. You can see peacocks early in the morning if you’re lucky.
srujana	Srujana	A little house. Has a lot of musical instruments. I don’t think you’re allowed in there if you’re not good at singing or playing instruments. Apparently, I’m banished from being within 10 metres of the building. 
aarogya	Aarogya	Want a medical leave? This is your place. Don’t ask me about treatment. Nope, no comments on that.
vindhya	Vindhya	Alright, brace yourselves. This building features A LOT of labs, I don’t even know how many. Carry a map with you. I’m serious. You don’t wanna tell your prof that you got late to class looking for the classroom. Also, this houses CIE, the biggest startup incubator of India. *proud smile*.
kcis	KCIS	Home to the largest labs in IIITH. We find students sneaking into here mission-impossible style (using aliases). Well, who wouldn’t want to study here. They have AC. 
himalaya	Himalaya	The actual college part of the college. Yes. The classrooms. Good place to doze off, except for the part where the slapping hand of the professor lands on your sleeping face.
thub	T-Hub	What? I don’t know. I am not allowed in here.
vc	VC	Vindhya Canteen. Is very cool. Maybe it’s the vibe it is set in. Among the trees, in the shade, after a long study session, have some food in VC.
